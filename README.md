Horoscoped

For one of our hackathons we created a Horoscope app that utilizes APIâ€™s (through the use of axios) to retrieve data when an individual user inputs their zodiac sign or their specific birthday. As such it will return one of the 12 astrological signs & a quote that is generated from the API/database.
